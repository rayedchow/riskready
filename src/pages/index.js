To me, taking these â€œsmall steps'' to slowly overcome the opioid epidemic is something that is not just necessary, but is essential to eliminating deaths due to overdose, and addiction within our country. I whole-heartedly believe that RiskReady will allow for change in these communities, and save countless lives around our nation.</div>

            <div className='text-center text-[#000000] text-xl font-normal mt-20 w-[70%] lightbg'>As a sophomore in high school, I have learned extensively of the dangerous effects behind opioid substance abuse, not only in school, but through the surroundings of my community. Over the past several months, I have heard countless stories of individuals overcoming addiction, some even being exposed to illegally-obtained prescription drugs from their youth. This is a major issue in our society, and it motivated me to use Machine Learning to help prevent it in the future and to provide resources.</div>

            <div className='text-center text-[#000000] text-xl font-normal mt-20 w-[70%] lightbg'>To me, the opioid epidemic is something that really hits home. As only a junior in highschool and coming from a family with a history of smoking and opioid use, I have made it my goal to help others that are also struggling with addiction, and to bring awareness to the epidemic that affects hundreds of thousands. I understand firsthand the effects of this virus that infects our country, and I intend to make a difference through the incorporation of AI and machine learning.</div>
